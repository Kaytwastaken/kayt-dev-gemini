### hi! im kayt!
you've found you way to the main deck of my home in the gemverse! there's little here, so i suggest you explore the rest of the ship

> the walls of the small, somewhat decepit, spacecraft are a little barren right now, though it seems the common area you're currently standing in has had some love and attention

=> /captains-room.gmi captain's room 
=> /reading-room.gmi  the library
=> /projects.gmi/     project board

> towards one wall of the common room, you see a shelf with some notebooks and scattered pages. upon closer inspection, it appears to be a copy of all the captain's writings outside of the library for quicker reading
=> /third-shelf.gmi

### more stuff from me
=> gemini://station.martinrue.com/diet7up  station!
