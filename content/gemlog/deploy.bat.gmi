# smol deploy script
Published: 2022-3-21

its probably rather ineficient, but idrc
to host my capsule im running agate on my linux box and pulling from a private git repo
to update that repo, im just using GH desktop on my machine, and running a remote deply script over ssh
```deploy.sh on my server
# clear
cd ~/kayt-dev-gemini/
echo "---------- Pulling from git ----------"
git pull git@github.com:Kaytwastaken/kayt-dev-gemini.git
echo "------- Restarting pm2 process -------"
echo "        -> pm2 delete kayt-dev-gemini"
echo "        -> ./start.sh"
pm2 delete kayt-dev-gemini
./start.sh
echo "------------ Deploy done -------------"
```

```start.sh on my server
echo "-Starting kayt-dev-gemini Agate server in pm2-"
pm2 --name kayt-dev-gemini start "~/kayt-dev-gemini/bin/agate --hostname kayt.dev --content ~/kayt-dev-gemini/content/ --lang en-US"
pm2 save
```

but naturally, i went, "what if i didn't need to open GHD to push to git"
so then i threw together deploy.bat on my machine

```deploy.bat on my desktop
IF [%1] == [] GOTO Exit

git commit -m %1
git push
ssh -t node@neuromancer ~/kayt-dev-gemini/deploy.sh

:Exit
exit

```

this is also the uh,, first time ive used git in the command line and the first time ive really used batch scripting
so i quickly learned that i need to git add  before commiting, so the script isn't,,, /overly/ useful, but i still like it!
i also learned how to do conditionals (kinda) in batch!
also console go brr and it make brain go :D
