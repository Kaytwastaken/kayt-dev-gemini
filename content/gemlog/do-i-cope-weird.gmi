so yk that feeling when a Whole Lot of Shit is happening and you just feel kinda echo
yeah
idk thats been happening a lot
and like all the time when im at school im just thinking
man i could be working on my website right now
i could be programming something
i feel like thats a weird way to cope
but ig it makes sense, its a creative outlet, someting to do other than think about all the just eugh happening

anyway drink some water, try going outside, take some deep breaths, have a good day :D
