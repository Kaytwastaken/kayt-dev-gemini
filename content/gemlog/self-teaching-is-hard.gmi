# self teaching is hard
Published: 2022-03-22

title ._.
im trying to rewrite pk-web in svelte right
and thats cool and all, awesome framework, good language, cool cool whatever
but then like, as i was writing the first version in next and react, i found a better version that someone else had written (and they were and still are in the process of rewriting it in svelte, that's why i decided to move mine to svelte as well) so some of my motivation for the project kinda died since someone else had beat me to the idea and did it better
but me being the spite filled person i am, finished the part i had been working on, and resolved to move onto rewiting later
well, im at that rewriting step, and hnnnggg teaching myself is hard
since im working in the same framework, i can read the source from that other project so i thought id do that to get a feel for how to do things
but im looking at the source right, and in some places i have absolutely 0 idea wtf is even happening
like
theres one file
that i just
have no clue whats happening
and the only reason that is, is because i actually have very little experience in js and even less ts
so there could be some very obvious things that i just dont understand because i dont know of the relavent features of the language
and the worst part, is i dont know where to go to learn those things
